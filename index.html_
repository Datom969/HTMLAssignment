        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>My name is Mustapha Wasiu Olawale, I'm a Mechanical Engineer working in a Fast 
            Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) industry, I am passionate about software engineering, and since we only live once and you can become whatever you want to be, so I am looking to switch career to software engineering.
            I started learning web development on my own but I wasn't consistent due to work and having to take care of my family.

        <h3>My Learning Goals</h3>
        <p>I joined Altschool Africa to achieve my dream of becoming a highly skilled software engineer. My learning goal is to know software engineering specifically frontend engineering well enough to get paid for it. This way, I have two great careers and I can choose whichever pays more (LOL). </p>
